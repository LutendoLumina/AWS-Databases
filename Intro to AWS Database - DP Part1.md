## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I'm learning about how cloud databases work, how to create and manage them, and how different AWS database services solve different types of data problems. By the end of these projects, I will have a solid undrstanding of RDS, DynamoDB, and other AWS database tools, know how to set up and connect to databases securely, and understand when to use which type of database. I'm learning about cloud databases because almost every modern application needs a place to store data, and knowing how to design, manage, and scale databases in the cloud is a key skill for cloud engineers, software engineers, and AI/ML developers.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

I will set aside each day to work on these database projects. I will keep myself accountable by racking my progress, checking off each project as I complete it, and staying committed to my learning schedule. My reward for completing this AWS Databases series will be celebrating the achievement with something I enjoy—whether it’s taking a break, treating myself, or moving confidently to the next step in my cloud journey.

### What are databases?

Databases are places where data is stored, organized, and managed so that applications can quickly save and retrieve information. They act like structured digital filing systems for everything from user profiles to payments to app settings.

Cloud engineers use databases to store application data safely, make sure it’s available when needed, and ensure it can scale as the application grows. They choose the right type of database, set it up in the cloud, secure it, and make sure it runs efficiently.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals are responsible for designing, building, and managing databases so that applications can store and retrieve data reliably. They make sure data stays safe, organized, backed up, and performs well even when many users are accessing it at the same time.

The most interesting part of their job is solving problems with data—like optimizing slow queries, designing the perfect data structure for an app, or making huge systems run smoothly. They also get to work with new technologies and architectures, which keeps things challenging and exciting.
