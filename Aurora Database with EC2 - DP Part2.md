## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon Aurora?

Amazon Aurora is a type of relational database and why it is useful because of the clusters which allow large-scale applications.

### How I used Amazon Aurora in this project

In today's project, I used Amazon Aurora to connect with an EC2 instance.

### One thing I didn't expect in this project was...

One thing I didn't expect in this project was how expensive it can be to run a database.

### This project took me...

The project took me 1 hour.

## In the first part of my project...

### Creating an Aurora Cluster

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. It's called relational because of how the rows relate to the columns.

Aurora is a good choice when you have a large scale application that you need a relational database for. This is because Aurora uses clusters which are great for more efficient practices.

## Halfway through I stopped!

I stopped creating my Aurora database because I need to create an EC2 Instance so that I can connect the Aurora database with the EC2 instance.

### Features of my EC2 instance

I created a new key pair for my EC2 instance because I want to securely connect to my EC2 instance with my Aurora database.

When I created my EC2 instance, I took particular note of the public IPv4 DNS address and name as well as the key-pair name so that I know what I have access to with the key pair.

## Then I could finish setting up my database

Aurora Database uses clusters because it handles large scale applications and operations by using clusters, the database instances are seperated by the kinds of operations (i.e reader instance vs writer instance).
